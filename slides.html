          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Teachers use outdated technology, or no technology at all for grading, storing, and creating assignments.</li>
            <li>This portion of a teachers' job robs time they could allocate to instructional design.</li>
            <li>Research indicates of those who go into teaching, 40-50% are gone within 5 years. The burdens on teachers need to be addressed.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

            <li>Gradebook functionality for managing grades, students, courses, and assignments.</li>
            <li>Future development plans that include automatically graded multiple choice assessments, simplified rubric creation and grading, and better student progress monitoring systems.</li>
