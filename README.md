These are the slides for my capstone presentation at Galvanize. My project is a scoring and assessment platform for teachers. Currently it includes views to manipulate student, course, and assignment data in the database to streamline course management and record keeping for teachers. Future development plans include automatically graded multiple choice assessments, rubric creation and scoring, and data-driven student performance monitoring.
